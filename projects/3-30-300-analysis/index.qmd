## Overview

This is one of the big projects in my PhD in which I'm doing an extensive analysis of the 3-30-300 rule in all cities in England. To accomplish this, I'm using the Vegetation Object Model (VOM) to segment indivudal trees. Then using Ordnance Survey data and Verisk Buildings, I do a (very) big data analysis of how each building and output area fares in terms of 3-30-300 metrics. There's a bunch of tools involved in this process, but the main ones are: Apache Sedona, Spark, NetworkX, and GeoPandas. Most plots in the paper were done in R. Would highly recommend reading the preprint
