For those unaware, Transmilenio is the main public transport service in Bogot√°, the capital of Colombia. As useful as it has been for many people since its opening over 20 years ago, many Bogotanos(as) compalin about its connectivty. For that reason I wanted to see how weel connected the stations are to one another, and it turns out the distribution of stations and routes is unbalanced. Most of the stations are located on the East side of the city going from North to South, which means that if you are traveling from West to East or vice versa, you have less options. Moreover, if you live in the West side and travel to North to West, you would have to go eastwards and the westwards to reach your destination. Find out more about the project in the [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@ancazugo/conectividad-en-estaciones-de-transmilenio), where you can see a full description, the visualization and code.
