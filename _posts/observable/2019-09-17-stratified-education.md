This is my first app in D3.js, where I want to illustrate the stratification of education in Colombia. Students graduating from high school in Colombia have to sit the Saber exams which evaluate a number of subjects (such as SAT in the US of A-levels in the UK). Here, using a continuos color scale, I show how stratified the results of the exam are. In Colombia, households are divided into 6 categories, from 1 to 6, according to their economic and social capabilities, so 1 is for the poor families and 6 is for really rich homes. As you can see, the economic differences translate into education results, in almost every department of Colombia. If you want to know more, check the [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@ancazugo/la-educacion-basica-en-colombia-si-esta-estratificada-los-e) for the live app and code.
