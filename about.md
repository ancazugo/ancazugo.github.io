Hello, I am AndrÃ©s Camilo ZÃºÃ±iga GonzÃ¡lez, a Colombian ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ biologist and environmental data scientist with a passion for leveraging computational tools to address global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and urban sustainability. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Risk at the University of Cambridge, where my research focuses on assessing the impacts of urban vegetation on healthy cities. My work integrates high-resolution satellite data, machine learning, and environmental modeling to improve urban tree management and promote green equity.

I hold a Masterâ€™s in Environmental Data Science from the University of Cambridge and a Masterâ€™s in Biological Sciences from Universidad de los Andes, where I specialized in paleoecology and ancient DNA. My research has spanned diverse areas, from characterizing methane production in Colombian pÃ¡ramo peatbogs to analyzing the effects of volcanic eruptions on ancient human settlements. I have also worked as a Data Scientist at DataLeik, developing machine learning models and APIs for real estate analytics.

Technically, I am proficient in R, Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, and LaTeX, and I have extensive experience with tools like ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, Docker, and AWS. I am also skilled in data visualization, web development, and deploying machine learning models. My work has been supported by prestigious grants, including the Minciencias Cambridge Scholarship and the National Geographic Early Career Grant.

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. I have designed and delivered courses on topics ranging from biostatistics and programming to machine learning and sustainability. I believe in the power of education to drive innovation and empower the next generation of scientists and technologists.

Aside from working in research and data stuff, I enjoy drawing, learning new languages, practising and watching football, tenis and basketball and playing (learning) piano.

My ultimate goal is to harness the power of artificial intelligence and data science to create sustainable solutions for our planetâ€™s most pressing environmental challenges. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others, so please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect or check my academic CV (<a href="assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_CV_en.pdf" target="_blank">ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</a>, <a href="assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_CV_es.pdf" target="_blank">ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸</a>) and professional rÃ©sumÃ© (<a href="assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_resume_en.pdf" target="_blank">ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</a>).
