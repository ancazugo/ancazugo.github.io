Hello, I am AndrÃ©s Camilo ZÃºÃ±iga GonzÃ¡lez, a Colombian ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´ biologist with a keen interest in programming and all its branches, from data science and machine learning, to web and game development. <b>My professional goal is to grow around the use of computation to help in the mitigation of the planet's pressing issues, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and food security.</b>

I have had experience working in the field of paleoecology at <a href="https://paleouniandes.weebly.com/">Paleolab</a>, specially in ancient and environmental DNA, as well as using other environmental proxies to understand changes in the past 11.000 thousand years.

At a technical level, I am proficient in several programming languages such as R, Python, Java, Javascript, LaTex, HTML, CSS, and softwares and frameworks including ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Office Suite and Git.

Aside from working in research and data analysis, I enjoy drawing, learning new languages, practising and watching football, tenis and basketball and playing (learning) piano and music composition.

If you are interested in my profile, feel free to reach out, or check my academic CV (<a href="assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_CV_en.pdf" target="_blank">ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§</a>, <a href="assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_CV_es.pdf" target="_blank">ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸</a>) and professional rÃ©sumÃ© (<a href="assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_resume_en.pdf" target="_blank">ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§</a>).
